    Sweetness, sweetness I was only joking
    When I said I'd like to
    Smash every tooth in your head
    
    Sweetness, sweetness I was only joking
    When I said by rights you should be
    Bludgeoned in your bed
    
    And now I know how Joan of Arc felt
    Now I know how Joan of Arc felt
    As the flames rose to her Roman nose
    And her Walkman started to melt
