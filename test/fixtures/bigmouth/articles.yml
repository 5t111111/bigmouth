    Sweetness, sweetness I was only joking
    When I said I'd like to
    Smash every tooth in your head
    
    Sweetness, sweetness I was only joking
    When I said by rights you should be
    Bludgeoned in your bed
    
    And now I know how Joan of Arc felt
    Now I know how Joan of Arc felt
    As the flames rose to her Roman nose
    And her Walkman started to melt

    Oh Mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head
    And as I climb into an empty bed
    Oh well. Enough said.
    I know it's over - still I cling
    I don't know where else I can go
